## 1. CPD 5.2.1 pre-check

Use a client workstation with internet (bastion or infra node) to download OCP and CPD images, and confirm the OS level, ensuring the OS is RHEL 8/9

```
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

Test internet connection, and make sure the output from the target URL and it can be connected successfully:

```
curl -v https://github.com/IBM
```

Prepare customer's IBM entitlement key

Log in to <https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary> with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled software.

On the Get entitlement key tab, select Copy key to copy the entitlement key to the clipboard.

Save the API key in a text file.

Make sure free disk space more than 500 GB (to download images and pack the images into a tar ball)

```
df -lh
```

Collect OCP and CPD cluster information

Log into OCP cluster from bastion node

```
oc login $(oc whoami --show-server) -u kubeadmin -p <kubeadmin-password>
```

Review OCP version

```
oc get clusterversion
```

Review storage classes

```
oc get sc
```

Review OCP cluster status

Make sure all nodes are in ready status

```
oc get nodes
```

Make sure all mc are in correct status, UPDATED all True, UPDATING all False, DEGRADED all False

```
oc get mcp
```

Make sure all co are in correct status, AVAILABLE all True, PROGRESSING all False, DEGRADED all False

```
oc get co
```

Make sure there are no unhealthy pods, if there are, please open an IBM support case to fix them.

```
oc get po -A -owide | egrep -v '([0-9])/\1' | egrep -v 'Completed' 
```

Get CPD installed projects

```
oc get pod -A | grep zen
```

Get CPD version and installed components

```
cpd-cli manage login-to-ocp \
--username=${OCP_USERNAME} \
--password=${OCP_PASSWORD} \
--server=${OCP_URL}
```

```
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

or

```
cpd-cli manage list-deployed-components --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Check the scheduling service, if it is installed but not in ibm-common-services project, uninstall it

```
oc get scheduling -A
```

Check install plan is automatic

```
oc get ip -A
```

Check the spec of each CPD custom resource, remove any patches before upgrading

```
oc project ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

```
for i in $(oc api-resources | grep cpd.ibm.com | awk '{print $1}'); do echo "************* $i *************"; for x in $(oc get $i --no-headers | awk '{print $1}'); do echo "--------- $x ------------"; oc get $i $x -o jsonpath={.spec} | jq; done ; done
```

Probe IBM registry (if required)

```
podman login cp.icr.io -u cp -p ${IBM_ENTITLEMENT_KEY}
```


## 2. Update cpd-cli and environment variables script for 5.2.2

Download and unpack the latest cpd-cli release

```
wget https://github.com/IBM/cpd-cli/releases/download/v14.2.2/cpd-cli-linux-EE-14.2.2.tgz && gzip -d cpd-cli-linux-EE-14.2.2.tgz && tar -xvf cpd-cli-linux-EE-14.2.2.tar && rm -rf cpd-cli-linux-EE-14.2.2.tar
```

Add the cpd-cli to your PATH variable, for example

```
export PATH=/root/cpd-cli-linux-EE-14.2.2-2727:$PATH
```

Update your environment variables script

```
vi cpd_vars.sh
```

Update the Version field and save your changes

```
VERSION=5.2.2
```

Source your environment variables

```
source cpd_vars.sh
```

Launch olm-utils-play-v3 container

```
cpd-cli manage restart-container
```


## 3. Backup CPD 5.2.1 CRs, cpd-instance, and cpd-operators namespaces

Create a new directory and store the output of the following commands in that directory

```
mkdir cpdbackup && cd cpdbackup && oc project ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
for i in $(oc api-resources | grep cpd.ibm.com | awk '{print $1}'); do echo "************* $i *************"; for x in $(oc get $i --no-headers | awk '{print $1}'); do echo "--------- $x ------------"; oc get $i $x -oyaml > bak-$x.yaml; done ; done
```

**Note: The following 'oc adm' commands can be time-consuming and should be collected during the pre-upgrade Health Check activity**

Backup the current state of operands in your backup folder of choice:

```
mkdir operandsbackup && cd operandsbackup && oc adm inspect -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} --dest-dir=source-${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} $(oc api-resources --namespaced=true --verbs=get,list --no-headers -o name | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
```

Backup the current state of operators in your backup folder of choice:

```
mkdir operatorsbackup && cd operatorsbackup && oc adm inspect -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} --dest-dir=source-${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} $(oc api-resources --namespaced=true --verbs=get,list --no-headers -o name | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
```

## 4. Revert Patches And Hot Fixes

It is recommended to remove patches or hot fixes before upgrading Cloud Pak for Data to avoid potential conflicts, inconsistencies, or compatibility issues that may arise during the upgrade process. 

Patches and hot fixes are typically applied to address specific issues or vulnerabilities, but they might not be fully compatible with the new CP4D version. 

Removing them before upgrading ensures a cleaner and more predictable upgrade experience, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or errors. 

The current list of patches that need to be reverted/removed are the following:
- Datastage Patch 4
- IKC 5.2.1 Connectivity Cumulative Patch
- Pipelines Hot Fix 1

### Remove DataStage Patch 4 (manual removal)

Set up your environment variables:

```
export PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS=cpd-operators
export PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS=cpd-instance
```

Revert the datastage catalog source to the original one backed up from Step 2b:

```
oc patch catsrc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-datastage-ent-plus-operator-catalog --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/image", "value":"icr.io/cpopen/ds-operator-catalog@sha256:5de312187d22e501f8f15230195e949330749a1fcd7ee44ca1b9fd759152837f"}]'
```

Verify the DataStage catalog source pod is up and running:

```
oc get pod -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} | grep ibm-cpd-datastage | grep catalog
```

Delete datastage subscription and CSV:

```
oc delete sub -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-datastage-operator

oc delete csv -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-datastage-operator.v8.1.0
```

Recreate datastage subscription for DataStage Enterprise Plus:

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ibm-cpd-datastage-operator
  namespace: ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS}
spec:
  channel: v8.1
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: ibm-cpd-datastage-operator
  source: ibm-cpd-datastage-ent-plus-operator-catalog
  sourceNamespace: ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS}
EOF
```

Wait for a few minutes for the CSV to be ready:

```
oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} get csv ibm-cpd-datastage-operator.v8.1.0 -o jsonpath="{.status.phase}"
```

Wait for datastage and pxruntime custom resources to reconcile to ‘Completed’ state:

```
oc get datastage datastage -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}

oc get pxruntime -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Monitor progress of both custom resources:

```
oc get datastage datastage -o yaml | grep progress
```

```
oc get pxruntime ds-px-default -o yaml | grep dsStatus
```

### IKC 5.2.1 Connectivity Cumulative Patch (manual removal)

Run the following command to edit the WKC or CCS custom resource:

```
oc patch ccs ccs-cr -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} --type=json --patch '[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/image_digests/wdp_connect_connection_image"},{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/image_digests/wdp_connect_connector_image"},{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/image_digests/wdp_connect_flight_image"}]'
```

Wait for operator reconciliation to complete. Run the following command to monitor the reconciliation status:

```
oc get wkc wkc-cr -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

or

```
oc get ccs ccs-cr -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

### Remove Pipelines Hot Fix 1 (manual removal)

Include steps to remove Pipelines Hot Fix 1

Set the following environment variable:

```
export PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS=cpd-operators
export PROJECT_CPD_INSTANCE=cpd-instance
```

Run the following patch command with the default image:
```
oc patch catsrc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/image", "value":"icr.io/cpopen/ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog@sha256:eadad9dcd823ffe857f4cfd2be4a3249a2e19d5ef4c48b2704db2999a6ce037a"}]'
```

Verify, that the catalog pod is up and running:

```
oc get pods -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} | grep ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog
```

Delete subscription and CSV:

```
oc delete sub -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog-subscription

oc delete csv -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-wspipelines.v11.1.0
```

Recreate subscription to initiate installation, make sure to replace <PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS> with the cpd operators namespace, such as "cpd-operators":

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog-subscription
  namespace: cpd-operators
spec:
  channel: v11.1
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: ibm-cpd-wspipelines
  source: ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog
  sourceNamespace: cpd-operators
EOF
```

Wait a few minutes for CSV to be ready:

```
oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} get csv ibm-cpd-wspipelines.v11.1.0 -o jsonpath="{.status.phase}"
```

Output should be:

```
Succeeded
```

Wait 15-20 minutes for reconciliation process to finish:

```
oc get wspipelines -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INSTANCE}
```

Output should be:

```
NAME             VERSION   RECONCILED   STATUS       PERCENT   AGE
wspipelines-cr   5.2.1     5.2.1        Completed    100%      35m
```

After all required patches have been reverted, proceed with the next step


## 5. Upgrade shared cluster components (ibm-cert-manager,ibm-licensing) (est. 5 minutes)

Determine which project the License Service is in

```
oc get deployment -A | grep ibm-licensing-operator
```

Upgrade the Certificate manager and License Service

```

Results should read "SUCCESS..."

[Next, apply entitlements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.2.x?topic=puish-applying-your-entitlements-3) (est. 1-2 minutes):

Run the apply-entitlement command for each solution that is installed or that you plan to install in this instance
Apply entitlements for CP4D (includes WKC and Mantaflow):


```
cpd-cli manage apply-entitlement \
--cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--entitlement=cpd-enterprise
```

Apply entitlements for DataStage:

```
cpd-cli manage apply-entitlement \
--cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--entitlement=datastage
```


## 7. Upgrade an instance of IBM Software Hub

Upgrade the required operators and custom resources for the instance:

Log the cpd-cli in to the Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform cluster:

```
${CPDM_OC_LOGIN}
```

Review the license terms for the software that you plan to install:

```
cpd-cli manage get-license \
--release=${VERSION} \
--license-type=EE
```

Upgrade the required operators and custom resources for the instance (est. 60 minutes):

```
cpd-cli manage setup-instance \
--license_acceptance=true \
--release=${VERSION} \
--cpd_operator_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
--cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--run_storage_tests=false \
--case_download=false \
--block_storage_class=${STG_CLASS_BLOCK}
```

You can optionally run this command with the run_storage_tests flag set to 'true':

```
--run_storage_tests=true
```

Monitor the upgrade progress of the custom resources with the following commands:

```
oc get ZenService lite-cr -n cpd-instance -o yaml
```

```
oc get Ibmcpd ibmcpd-cr -n cpd-instance -o yaml
```

```
cpd-cli manage apply-olm \
--release=${VERSION} \
--cpd_operator_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
--upgrade=true \
--case_download=false
```

Wait for the cpd-cli to return the following message before proceeding to the next step:

[SUCCESS]... The apply-olm command ran successfully

Confirm that the operator pods are Running or Completed:

```
oc get pods --namespace=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS}
```


## 8. Upgrade CPD services (datastage_ent_plus,ws_pipelines,wkc,mantaflow)

### Upgrade WKC custom resource (est. 92 minutes):

Before proceeding with the IKC upgrade steps, confirm that the post-upgrade steps have been completed from the previous 5.2.0 upgrade - [Post-upgrade setup for IBM Knowledge Catalog](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.2.x?topic=upgrading-post-upgrade-setup-knowledge-catalog)

After you successfully upgraded IBM Knowledge Catalog from Version 4.8, 5.0, or 5.1 to Version 5.2, you must migrate all IBM Knowledge Catalog data from the previously used Db2 and CouchDB databases to the EDB Native PostgreSQL database that is used in Version 5.2.

After all data that was stored in Db2 is successfully migrated to EDB Postgres, remove all Db2U-related resources from IBM Knowledge Catalog

Verify that the data was migrated without any data loss by checking the migration summary

Get the data-migration pod names:

```
oc get pod -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} | grep data-migration
```

Access the log for a specific pod by using this command. Replace <migration-pod-name> with the name of the pod that was used for migration:

```
oc logs <migration-pod-name>
```

The pod logs contain a migration summary that shows the row counts for each table in Db2 and EDB Postgres, and the total number of rows in either database, similar to these examples:

```
{"message": "33/34 BG.WORKFLOW_ASSET (BGDB): 2,156 rows created in postgres (2,156 rows in DB2)", "timestamp": "2025-07-30 12:16:13,227", "levelname": "INFO"}
{"message": "34/34 BG.SCHEMAVERSION (BGDB): 1 rows created in postgres (1 rows in DB2)", "timestamp": "2025-07-30 12:16:13,227", "levelname": "INFO"}
{"message": "Total number of rows in DB2: 16,931", "timestamp": "2025-07-30 12:16:13,228", "levelname": "INFO"}
{"message": "Total number of rows in Postgres: 16,931", "timestamp": "2025-07-30 12:16:13,228", "levelname": "INFO"}
```

To identify missing data, compare the row counts for each table in Db2 and EDB Postgres

Next, delete the IBM Knowledge Catalog Db2U cluster:

```
oc delete db2ucluster db2oltp-wkc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Verify that the Db2U StatefulSet and pod were deleted

To check the StatefulSet:

```
oc get sts -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} | grep db2u
```

To check the pod:

```
oc get pods -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} | grep db2u
```

Next, delete the IBM Knowledge Catalog Db2U PVCs:

```
oc delete pvc c-db2oltp-wkc-meta data-c-db2oltp-wkc-db2u-0 wkc-db2u-backups -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Delete the IBM Knowledge Catalog Db2U init job:

```
oc delete job wkc-db2u-init -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Once the Db2U resources have been cleaned up, proceed with the following steps to check that Postgres cluster replicas are synchronized

***Potential Issue Prior to WKC/CCS upgrade - PostgreSQL cluster replicas get out of sync*** - [PostgreSQL cluster replicas get out of sync](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/5.0.x?topic=platform-postgresql-cluster-replicas-get-out-sync)

This issue can manifest in several ways:
- You see a mismatch in the data between the replicas
- The database cluster is stuck in the Waiting for the instances to become active state

To check the status of the database cluster, run:

```
oc get clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

To confirm that the replicas are out of sync search the PostgreSQL operator logs for the phrase WAL:

```
oc logs -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
-l app.kubernetes.io/name=cloud-native-postgresql \
| grep "WAL"
```

Look for messages with the following phrases:
- missing WAL files
- tried restoring WALs

Search the PostgreSQL pod logs for the phrase Failed to execute pg_rewind:

```
oc logs -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
-l app.kubernetes.io/name=cloud-native-postgresql \
| grep '"level":"error"' \
| grep 'Failed to execute pg_rewind'
```

Set the POSTGRES_CLUSTER environment variable to the name of the PostgreSQL cluster where you want to check the replica status:

```
export POSTGRES_CLUSTER=<cluster-name>
```

Run the following command to see a list of any PostgreSQL cluster in the project:

```
oc get clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io \
-n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Set the PRIMARY_POD, PRIMARY_POD_LSN, REPLICA_POD, and REPLICA_POD_LSN environment variables:

***Environments with one replica pod***

Set the PRIMARY_POD and REPLICA_POD environment variables:

```
export PRIMARY_POD=$(oc get pod -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} -l k8s.enterprisedb.io/cluster=${POSTGRES_CLUSTER},role=primary -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```

```
export REPLICA_POD=$(oc get pod -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} -l k8s.enterprisedb.io/cluster=${POSTGRES_CLUSTER},role=replica -o name)
```

Set the PRIMARY_POD_LSN and REPLICA_POD_LSN environment variables:

```
export PRIMARY_POD_LSN=$(oc exec ${PRIMARY_POD} -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} -c postgres -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();" | sed -n '3p' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' -e 's/[ \t]*$//')
```

```
export REPLICA_POD_LSN=$(oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} exec -t ${REPLICA_POD} $ -c postgres -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT pg_last_wal_replay_lsn();" | sed -n '3p' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' -e 's/[ \t]*$//')
```

***Environments with multiple replica pods***

Set the PRIMARY_POD environment variable:

```
export PRIMARY_POD=$(oc get pod -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} -l k8s.enterprisedb.io/cluster=${POSTGRES_CLUSTER},role=primary -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
```

Get the name of the replica pods:

```
oc get pod -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} -l k8s.enterprisedb.io/cluster=${POSTGRES_CLUSTER},role=replica -o name
```

The command returns the list of pods that are associated with the specified PostgreSQL cluster (${POSTGRES_CLUSTER}).

Set the REPLICA_POD environment variable to one of the replica pods:

```
export REPLICA_POD=<pod-name>
```

Set the PRIMARY_POD_LSN and REPLICA_POD_LSN environment variables:

```
export PRIMARY_POD_LSN=$(oc exec ${PRIMARY_POD} -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} -c postgres -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();" | sed -n '3p' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' -e 's/[ \t]*$//')
```

```
export REPLICA_POD_LSN=$(oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} exec -t ${REPLICA_POD} $ -c postgres -- psql -U postgres -c "SELECT pg_last_wal_replay_lsn();" | sed -n '3p' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' -e 's/[ \t]*$//')
```

For each replica, compare the LSN for the primary node and the replica pod:

```
echo $PRIMARY_POD_LSN, $REPLICA_POD_LSN
```

***Solving the Problem***

Check whether the EDB Postgres cluster is fenced:

```
oc get clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io ${POSTGRES_CLUSTER} -o yaml | grep fencedInstances
```

If the EDB Postgres cluster is fenced, lift the fencing:

```
oc annotate clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io ${POSTGRES_CLUSTER} k8s.enterprisedb.io/fencedInstances-
```

Wait several minutes, then check the status of the EDB Postgres cluster:

```
oc get clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io ${POSTGRES_CLUSTER} \
-n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

If the status is Cluster in healthy state, no additional resolution is required.

If the status is not Cluster in healthy state, continue to the next step.

Get the name of the persistent volume claim associated with the replica pod:

```
oc describe pod ${REPLICA_POD} -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

In the Volumes section, get the ClaimName. The name of the persistent volume claim is usually the same as the name of the replica pod

Delete the persistent volume claim where the claim name is the same as the replica pod name:

```
oc delete pvc ${REPLICA_POD} -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Delete the persistent volume claim where the claim name is different from the replica pod name:

```
oc delete pvc <pvc-name> -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Delete the replica pod:

```
oc delete pod ${REPLICA_POD} -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

After fixing any Postgres cluster replica sync issues you are now ready to upgrade WKC

Set the IKC_TYPE environment variable:

```
export IKC_TYPE=wkc
```

When you upgrade IBM Knowledge Catalog, the options that you specified when you installed IBM Knowledge Catalog are used

Ensure you have specified the correct installation options in the install-options.yml in the cpd-cli work directory (For example: cpd-cli-workspace/olm-utils-workspace/work)

IBM Knowledge Catalog - The following values were extracted from the latest revision of HUK internal runbook:

```
################################################################################
# IBM Knowledge Catalog parameters
################################################################################
custom_spec:
  wkc:
#    enableDataQuality: True
#    enableSemanticAutomation: False
#    enableKnowledgeGraph: True
#    useFDB: True
```

Log the cpd-cli in to the Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform cluster:

```
${CPDM_OC_LOGIN}
```

Update the custom resource for IBM Knowledge Catalog:

```
cpd-cli manage apply-cr \
--components=${IKC_TYPE} \
--release=${VERSION} \
--cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--param-file=/tmp/work/install-options.yml \
--license_acceptance=true \
--upgrade=true \
--case_download=false
```

***Potential Issue After Initiating WKC Upgrade and CCS Upgrade - jobs-api pod***

1. Get the superuser URI to the jobs-postgres cluster:

```
oc get secret ccs-jobs-postgres-superuser -o jsonpath="{.data.uri}" | base64 -d
```

The output should look like following:

```
postgresql://postgres:{password}@ccs-jobs-postgres-rw.{namespace}:5432/*
```

Replace the /* at the end with /jobruns, for example:

```
postgresql://postgres:{password}@ccs-jobs-postgres-rw.{namespace}:5432/jobruns
```

2. Exec into one of the running jobs-api pods and initiate the node interactive shell with the following command:

```
oc get po | grep jobs-api
```

```
oc rsh {jobs-api-pod-name} bash -c "cd /home/node/jobs-api; node"
```

3. Replace the URI value in the below text, copy and paste them into the interactive prompt and press enter:

```
const { Pool } = require("pg");
```

```
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: "<URI from Step 1>" });
```

```
(await pool.query(`ALTER TYPE state OWNER TO jobsapi;`));
```


4. Press CTRL + D to exit the node interactive shell and type “exit” to exit the jobs-api environment

You may need to recycle the jobs-api pod:

```
oc delete po {jobs-api-pod-name} -n $PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS
```

The 5.2.1 jobs-api pods should now initialize properly and the IKC upgrade will continue

Export the following environment variables:

```
export PROJECT_CPD_INSTANCE=cpd-instance
export PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS=cpd-operators
```

Create a backup of the current catalog image:

```
oc -n $PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS get CatalogSources ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog -o=jsonpath="{.spec.image}"
```

Patch Orchestration Pipelines catalog source:

```
oc patch catsrc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/image", "value":"icr.io/cpopen/ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog@sha256:f063d55e085568eca73015f72807290317fe09da8620b5d53d8eebe321bf7d7d"}]'
```

Verify that the catalog pod is up and running:

```
oc get pods -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} | grep ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog
```

Delete subscription and CSV:

```
oc delete sub -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog-subscription
oc delete csv -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-wspipelines.v11.2.0
```

Recreate subscription to initiate installation, but make sure to replace <PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS> with the cpd operators project:

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog-subscription
  namespace: $PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS
spec:
  channel: v11.2
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: ibm-cpd-wspipelines
  source: ibm-cpd-wspipelines-operator-catalog
  sourceNamespace: $PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS
EOF
```

Wait a few minutes for CSV to be ready:

```
oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS} get csv ibm-cpd-wspipelines.v11.1.0 -o jsonpath="{.status.phase}"
```

Output should be:

```
Succeeded
```

Add the hotfix label to the CSV:

```
oc label csv ibm-cpd-wspipelines.v11.2.0 -n $PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS support.operator.ibm.com/hotfix=true
```

To verify the newly-added label, please check:

```
oc get csv ibm-cpd-wspipelines.v11.2.0 -n $PROJECT_CPD_OPERATORS -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}'
```

Wait 15 to 20 minutes for reconciliation process to finish:

```
oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INSTANCE} get wspipelines
```

Output should be:

```
NAME             VERSION   RECONCILED   STATUS       PERCENT   AGE
wspipelines-cr   5.2.2     5.2.2        Completed    100%      35m
```

### Upgrade DataStage custom resource (est. 11 minutes):

***Potential Issue During DataStage Custom Resource Upgrade***

During the previous upgrade we encountered an issue in which the DataStage operator pod was crashing, for example:

```
oc get po -n $PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS | grep datastage-operator
```

```
ibm-cpd-datastage-operator-665cd9c4d8-9mxw9                       0/1     CrashLoopBackOff     8          77h
```

Upon closer inspection of the datastage operator pod, we discovered the pod was crashing due to an OOMKilled error:

```
oc describe pod ibm-cpd-datastage-operator-665cd9c4d8-9mxw9 -n $PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS
```

Under the status -> conditions section, look for any errors, such as OOMKilled

In order to address this, increase the datastage operator pod memory by updating the memory requests/limits in the CSV:

```
oc get csv -A | grep datastage
```

```
oc edit csv ibm-cpd-datastage-operator.v8.0.0
```

Increase the memory limit from 1Gi to 2Gi:

```
resources:
  limits:
	cpu: 500m
	memory: 2Gi

```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to be applied before proceeding with the upgrade

Set the ${DATASTAGE_TYPE} variable to the edition of DataStage that you want to install:

```
export DATASTAGE_TYPE=datastage_ent_plus
```

Log the cpd-cli in to the Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform cluster:

```
${CPDM_OC_LOGIN}
```

Update the custom resource for DataStage:

```
cpd-cli manage apply-cr \
--components=${DATASTAGE_TYPE} \
--release=${VERSION} \
--cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--license_acceptance=true \
--upgrade=true \
--case_download=false
```


Monitor the status of the DataStage custom resource:

```
oc get DataStage datastage -o yaml
```

DataStage is upgraded when the apply-cr command returns:

[SUCCESS]... The apply-cr command ran successfully

Note: The service instances are automatically upgraded when you upgrade DataStage

If you want to confirm that the custom resource status is Completed, you can run the cpd-cli manage get-cr-status command:

```
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status \
--cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--components=datastage_ent_plus
```

After DataStage upgrade is complete, apply DataStage 5.2.2 Patch 1

Run the following commands to back up datastage and pxruntime custom resources:

```
oc get datastage datastage -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} -o yaml > datastage_backup.yaml
```

```
oc get pxruntime [instance-name] -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} -o yaml > [instance_name]_backup.yaml
```

Run the following command to back up the current datastage catalog source image for datastage enterprise plus edition:

```
oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} get CatalogSources ibm-cpd-datastage-ent-plus-operator-catalog -o=jsonpath="{.spec.image}"
```

Wait for datastage catalog source pod is up and running:  

```
oc get pod -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} | grep ibm-cpd-datastage | grep catalog
```

Delete datastage subscription and CSV:

```
oc delete sub -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-datastage-operator
```

```
oc delete csv -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} ibm-cpd-datastage-operator.v8.2.0 v8.2.0
```

Recreate datastage subscription for datastage enterprise plus edition, run:

```
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: ibm-cpd-datastage-operator
  namespace: ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS}
spec:
  channel: v8.2
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: ibm-cpd-datastage-operator
  source: ibm-cpd-datastage-ent-plus-operator-catalog
  sourceNamespace: ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS}
EOF
```

Wait for a few minutes for the CSV to be ready: 

```
oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} get csv ibm-cpd-datastage-operator.v8.2.0 -o jsonpath="{.status.phase}"
```

Wait for datastage and pxruntime custom resources to reconcile to ‘Completed’ state:

```
oc get datastage datastage -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

```
oc get pxruntime -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

This marks the end of the datastage upgrade procedure


### Post-upgrade of all custom resources (est. <1 minute):

After all custom resources have been updated, enable the zen-rsi-evictor-cron-job CronJob:

```
oc patch CronJob zen-rsi-evictor-cron-job \
--namespace=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--type=merge \
--patch='{"spec":{"suspend": false}}'
```


## 9. Upgrade the cpdbr service:

Upgrade the cpdbr-tenant component for the instance

The command that you run depends on the type of storage that you use, where the cluster pulls images from, and whether the scheduling service is installed

For IBM Fusion environments without the scheduling service, run the following commands:

```
export CPDBR_OADP_IMAGE_VERSION=${VERSION}.amd64
export SPP_CPDBR_IMAGE_NAME=cpdbr-oadp:${CPDBR_OADP_IMAGE_VERSION}
cpd-cli oadp client config set namespace=ibm-backup-restore
cpd-cli oadp client config set cpd-namespace=cp4d
export OADP_PROJECT=ibm-backup-restore
export PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS=cp4d-operators
export PRIVATE_REGISTRY_LOCATION="nexus.lan.huk-coburg.de:2743"
```

```
cpd-cli oadp install \
--component=cpdbr-tenant \
--cpdbr-hooks-image-prefix=${PRIVATE_REGISTRY_LOCATION} \
--tenant-operator-namespace=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
--cpdbr-hooks-image-prefix=${PRIVATE_REGISTRY_LOCATION}/cpopen/cpd \
--cpfs-image-prefix=${PRIVATE_REGISTRY_LOCATION}/cpopen/cpfs \
--upgrade=true \
--log-level=debug \
--verbose
```


## 10. Upgrade privileged monitors (est. 2 minutes)

Log the cpd-cli in to the Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform cluster:

```
${CPDM_OC_LOGIN}
```

Upgrade the privileged monitors

The command that you run depends on whether you want the Operator namespace status check to include information about the scheduling service

To include only information about the operators project run the following command:

```
cpd-cli manage apply-privileged-monitoring-service \
--privileged_service_ns=${PROJECT_PRIVILEGED_MONITORING_SERVICE} \
--cpd_operator_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
--cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```


## 11. Upgrade the configuration admission controller webhook (est. 2 minutes):

Log the cpd-cli in to the Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform cluster:

```
${CPDM_OC_LOGIN}
```

Upgrade the configuration admission controller webhook for x86_64 clusters:

```
cpd-cli manage install-cpd-config-ac \
--cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--cpd_config_ac_image=${PRIVATE_REGISTRY_LOCATION}/cpopen/cpd/zen-rsi-adm-controller:${VERSION}.amd64 \
--case_download=false
```
